### 🚀 OVERALL PROJECT GOALS (The Vision)
Beyond the current code available here, the full project is scaling toward the following milestones:

#### 1. Interface & Navigation

    * **Legacy:** 640x480, 800x600
    * **Standard:** 1280x720, 1366x768
    * **Full HD:** 1920x1080
* **Advanced AI:** Dynamic scaling and unique behavior patterns for the full cast.

#### 3. Visuals & Content
* **Animations:** Fluid jumpscares and environmental "twitches."
* **Full Campaign:** Completion of Nights 2 through 5, plus the "unreachable" bonus content.
* **Art Pass:** Finalizing high-resolution textures and dynamic lighting.
